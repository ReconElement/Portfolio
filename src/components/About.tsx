                <p>
                As a young developer I'm interested in obtaining new skills and honing the ones I already have into productive application. 
                </p>
                <p>
                I am a highly motivated and collaborative individual. I have actively participated in coding projects and hackathons, where I have worked with diverse teams to solve complex problems under tight deadlines.
